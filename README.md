The website displays a list of students from Hogwarts school. You can search, sort, and filter students by first name, last name, and house. From the modal window, you can expel a student, add him to the inquisitorial squad, or appoint a prefect. 

Clicking the “Hack the system” logo in the upper right corner of the page will randomize students’ blood status, enroll you in Hogwarts, and remove all students from the inquisitorial squad if any.

Process: 
- Cleaning up the messed data from the JSON file using JavaScript string methods to capitalize first letters in names and houses, to remove spaces before and after names if present, to split full names into first, middle, last, and optional aliases, and build images sources. 
- Calculating blood status using an additional JSON file with a list of pure- and half-blooded families.
- Adding a search field that immediately limits the listed students to those matching the search criteria. 
- Adding a possibility to sort names and houses in alphabetical order (ascending and descending).
- Adding an option to filter students by the house, as well as show a list of students who are expelled, with prefects or from the inquisitorial squad. 
- Adding a possibility to expel a student without a chance to enroll him back.
- Adding an option to add a student to the inquisitorial squad. Only students with pure blood or from the Slytherin house can be added.
- Adding an option to appoint a prefect to a student. Only two students from each house can be selected as prefects. 
- Displaying the number of students in each list.
- Removing all students from the inquisitorial squad, when the system is hacked.
- Randomizing students’ blood status where students with pure blood get random status, and with half and muggle blood become pure-bloods.
- Enrolling a hacker in Hogwarts with no chance to be expelled.
